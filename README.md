### BMC Firmware Update
<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/cab7306/openbmc/firmware-update.png">

This is a secure flash update mechanism to update BMC firmware via WebUI.

**Source URL**

* [https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/phosphor-bmc-code-mgmt](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/phosphor-bmc-code-mgmt)

**How to use**

* Update firmware via WebUI
    1. Upload update package from web UI, then you will see
        ```
        Activate
        ```
        > If you select activate, then you will see activation dialog at item 2

        ```
        Delete
        ```
        > If you select delete, then the package will be deleted right now

    2. Confirm BMC firmware file activation
        ```
        ACTIVATE FIRMWARE FILE WITHOUT REBOOTING BMC
        ```
        > If you select this, you need to reboot BMC manually, and shutdown application will run update script to flash image into SPI flash

        ```
        ACTIVATE FIRMWARE FILE AND AUTOMATICALLY REBOOT BMC
        ```
        > if you select this, BMC will shutdown right now, and shutdown application will run update script to flash image into SPI flash

* Update firmware via Redfish

    We can update BMC firmware via REST API provided by Redfish. The firmware will apply immediately after uploaded without any confirmation by default.
    The following command shows how to using curl command upload BMC firmware.
    ```
    curl -X POST -H "x-auth-token: ${token}" --data-binary obmc-phosphor-image-olympus-nuvoton.static.mtd.tar https://${BMC_IP}/redfish/v1/UpdateService
    ```
    >_${token} is the token value come from login API, read more information from [REST README](https://github.com/openbmc/docs/blob/master/REST-cheatsheet.md)_

### BIOS update
<img align="right" width="40%" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/0771b2f/openbmc/bios_update_demo.PNG">
  This BIOS update function is implemented according to Openbmc firmware update mechanism. Users can update BIOS just like they update BMC firmware via web UI.


**Source URL**

* [https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/phosphor-bmc-code-mgmt](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/phosphor-bmc-code-mgmt)
* [https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-phosphor/nuvoton-layer/recipes-phosphor/ipmi/phosphor-ipmi-flash_%25.bbappend](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-phosphor/nuvoton-layer/recipes-phosphor/ipmi/phosphor-ipmi-flash_%25.bbappend)

**How to use**

* Prepare the BIOS image for update

  1. MANIFEST

      The manifest for BIOS must set *purpose=xyz.openbmc_project.Software.Version.VersionPurpose.Host*, and provide version information.
      Others information just set as BMC manifest.
      ```
      purpose=xyz.openbmc_project.Software.Version.VersionPurpose.Host
      version=F0B_1B01.07
      KeyType=OpenBMC
      HashType=RSA-SHA256
      ```

  2. BIOS firmware

      rename BIOS image to image-bios
      ```
      mv BIOS image-bios
      ```

  3. public key

      Prepare your own key pair for sign BIOS firmware, and put the public key in image. Then sign the image-bios as following command:
      ```
      openssl dgst -sha256 -sign userkey.priv -out image-bios.sig image-bios
      ```
  4. Sign MANIFEST and public key

      Follow the BMC update signature verify flow, we also need sign MANIFEST and user public key by BMC system key.
      ```
      openssl dgst -sha256 -sign OpenBMC.priv -out MANIFEST.sig MANIFEST
      openssl dgst -sha256 -sign OpenBMC.priv -out publickey.sig publickey
      ```

  5. Collect data and tar image

      Now we have six files, and we just need tar them to a file.
      ```
      tar -cf image-bios.tar image-bios image-bios.sig MANIFEST MANIFEST.sig publickey publickey.sig
      ```

* Update BIOS

  There are two way updating BIOS image just like BMC firmware update.

  1. WebUI

      Upload tar image, and active it.
      ```
      Server configuration
       -> Firmware
         -> Choose file (select image-bios.tar)
         -> Click "Upload firmware" button
         -> Click "Active" link
             -> Select "ACTIVATE FIRMWARE FILE AND AUTOMATICALLY REBOOT SERVER"
             -> Click Continue
      ```

  2. Redfish

      We can update BIOS image via REST API just like BMC firmware. And the image will apply immediately after uploaded by default.
      ```
      curl -X POST -H "x-auth-token: ${token}" --data-binary image-bios.tar https://${BMC_IP}/redfish/v1/UpdateService
      ```

### Server Power Operations
<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/8fc19a1/openbmc/power_ops.png">

Server Power Operations are using to Power on/Warm reboot/Cold reboot/Orderly shutdown/Immediate shutdown remote host PC.

**Source URL**

* [https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/tree/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/chassis](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/tree/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/chassis)

**How to use**

1. Configure reaction of power button on generic host OS
    * When host OS is running **Linux** and you press **PWRON** header on motherboard, you're prompted with a list of options - this is the **interactive** shutdown. The OS will go **Orderly shutdown** for a while if you didn't select any action from it. If you don't want this interactive shutdown pop up and hope OS go **Orderly shutdown** directly, you can enter below command in terminal before testing:
      ```
      gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power button-power 'shutdown'
      ```
    * When host OS is running **Windows** and you press **PWRON** header on motherboard, the default reaction is **Orderly shutdown**. Thus, you didn't need to configure reaction of power button in Windows. But, if you find the default reaction is not **Orderly shutdown**, please check `Control Panel`->`Power Options`->`System Settings` in Windows OS.

    * About Watchdog patch

      There is a package **phosphor-watchdog** included in OpenBMC now. The watchdog daemon is started on host's power on, which is used to monitor if host is alive. In normal case, when host starts, it will send IPMI commands to kick watchdog and so everything would work fine. If host fails to start, the watchdog eventually timeout. However, the default watchdog timeout action is **HardReset** which is defined at [Watchdog.interface.yaml](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/blob/master/xyz/openbmc_project/State/Watchdog.interface.yaml) in **phosphor-dbus-interfaces** that will cause host rebooted after power on.

2. Configure GPIO pin definitions for **POWER_SW**, **RESET_SW** and **PGOOD** on BMC

    * Pin **POWER_SW** (GPIO505) is use to do all server power operations, pin **RESET_SW** (GPIO504) is reserve for reset operations, and **PGOOD** (GPIO506) is use to monitor DC real status that indicate `Server power` in WebUI.

    * If other GPIO pins are preferred, please modify the file [gpio_defs.json](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/skeleton/obmc-libobmc-intf/gpio_defs.json).

    * Content below is a part of **gpio_defs.json** for this sample:
      ```
      "power_config": {
          "power_good_in": "PGOOD",
          "power_up_outs": [
              {"name": "POWER_UP_PIN", "polarity": false},
              {"name": "POWER_UP_PIN", "polarity": true}
          ]
      }

      "name": "PGOOD",
      "num": 506,
      "direction": "in"

      "name": "POWER_UP_PIN",
      "num": 505,
      "direction": "out"

      "name": "RESET_UP_PIN",
      "num": 504,
      "direction": "out"
      ```
      > _"name" here is referred in code and fixed, please don't modify it. "num"  means GPIO pin number and changeable here, "direction" should be set as "in" for **PGOOD**, "out" for **RESET_UP_PIN** and **POWER_UP_PIN**, and "polarity" should be set as "false" then set as "true" for **POWER_UP_PIN** accordind NPCM750 schematic._

3. Server Power on
    * Press `Power on` button from `Server control` ->`Server power operations` of WebUI.

      > _[obmc-host-start@.target](https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc/blob/master/meta-phosphor/recipes-core/systemd/obmc-targets/obmc-host-start%40.target) is the one driving the boot of the system._

4. Server Power off (Soft)
    * Press `Orderly shutdown` button from `Server control` ->`Server power operations` of WebUI.

      > _The soft server power off function is encapsulated in the [obmc-host-shutdown@.target](https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc/blob/master/meta-phosphor/recipes-core/systemd/obmc-targets/obmc-host-shutdown%40.target) that is soft in that it notifies the host of the power off request and gives it a certain amount of time to shut itself down._

5. Server Power off (Hard)
    * Press `Immediate shutdown` button from `Server control` ->`Server power operations` of WebUI.

      > _The hard server power off is encapsulated in the [obmc-chassis-hard-poweroff@.target](https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc/blob/master/meta-phosphor/recipes-core/systemd/obmc-targets/obmc-chassis-hard-poweroff%40.target) that will force the stopping of the soft power off service if running, and immediately cut power to the system._

6. Server Reboot (Warm)
    * Press `Warm reboot` button from `Server control` ->`Server power operations` of WebUI.

      > _The warm reboot of the server is encapsulated in the [obmc-host-reboot@.target](https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc/blob/master/meta-phosphor/recipes-core/systemd/obmc-targets/obmc-host-reboot%40.target) that will utilize the server power off (soft) target [obmc-host-shutdown@.target](https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc/blob/master/meta-phosphor/recipes-core/systemd/obmc-targets/obmc-host-shutdown%40.target) and then, once that completes, start the host power on target [obmc-host-start@.target](https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc/blob/master/meta-phosphor/recipes-core/systemd/obmc-targets/obmc-host-start%40.target)._

7. Server Reboot (Cold)
    * Press `Cold reboot` button from `Server control` ->`Server power operations` of WebUI.

      > _The cold reboot of the server is shutdown server immediately, then restarts it. This target will utilize the Immediate shutdown target [obmc-chassis-hard-poweroff@.target](https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc/blob/master/meta-phosphor/recipes-core/systemd/obmc-targets/obmc-chassis-hard-poweroff%40.target) and then, start the host power on target [obmc-host-start@.target](https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc/blob/master/meta-phosphor/recipes-core/systemd/obmc-targets/obmc-host-start%40.target)._

### Certificate Management
<img align="right" width="50%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/master/openbmc/ssl_certificate.png">  

Manage the certificates installed on BMC.  
* Web Server certificate
* LDAP Client certificate
* CA certificate  

Management operations:
* Install a new certificate.  
* Replace an existing certificate. 
* Delete an existing certificate. 

**Source URL**
* [https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-certificate-manager](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-certificate-manager)

**How to use**  
1. Web server certificate  
   * Web server certificate is used to initiate a SSL session with browsers.
   * bmcweb will generate a self-signed certificate if no server certificate exists.
   * certificate file path
     > /etc/ssl/certs/https/server.pem
   * replace certificate with new one.
     * generate a new self-signed certificate using openssl. 
     ```
     openssl req -x509 -sha256 -newkey rsa:2048  -nodes -days 365  -keyout cert.pem -out cert.pem  -subj "/O=XYZ Corporation /CN=www.xyz.com"
     ```
     * replace certificate by the new cert "cert.pem" via WebUI.  
       <img align="top" width="70%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/master/openbmc/replace_cert.png">
     * restart bmcweb service on BMC.  
       > systemctl restart bmcweb  
       
     * connect to BMC web server and check the web certificate issuer from browser, it should be "www.xyz.com".      
       <img align="top" width="30%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/master/openbmc/new_certificate.png">
2. CA certificate
   * if server authentication is required in a TLS session, LDAP client will use CA certificate (issuer of server certificate) to verify server's identity when initiating a TLS session.
   * refer to [LDAP server setup](#ldap-server-setup) to generate a CA certificate and configure LDAP server.
     * Note: CN in LDAP server certificate must match server's URI (i.e. IP address or hostname).
       ```
       #example ssl command to generate server certificate
       openssl genrsa -out ldap_server.key 2048
       openssl req -new -key ldap_server.key -out ldap_server.csr -subj '/C=OO/ST=OO/L=OO/O=OO/OU=OO/CN=10.103.152.11'
       openssl x509 -req -days 365 -CA ca_cert.pem -CAkey ca_key.pem -CAcreateserial -CAserial serial -in ldap_server.csr -out ldap_server.pem
       ```
   * install CA certificate onto BMC via WebUI

3. LDAP client certificate
   * if client authentication is required in a TLS session, LDAP server will use CA certificate (issuer of client certificate) to verify client's identity when initiating a TLS session. BMC needs to install a client certificate signed with CA certificate.
   * generate a client certificate with signature signed with CA certificate.

## System

### Time
  * **SNTP**
    	Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a networking protocol for clock synchronization between computer systems over packet-switched, variable-latency data networks.

    **systemd-timesyncd** is a daemon that has been added for synchronizing the system clock across the network. It implements an **SNTP (Simple NTP)** client. This daemon runs with minimal privileges, and has been hooked up with **systemd-networkd** to only operate when network connectivity is available.
        
    The modification time of the file **/var/lib/systemd/timesync/clock** indicates the timestamp of the last successful synchronization (or at least the **systemd build date**, in case synchronization was not possible).
    
    **Source URL**
    * [https://github.com/systemd/systemd/tree/master/src/timesync](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/tree/master/src/timesync)
    
    **How to use**
    <img align="right" width="30%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/master/openbmc/Time.PNG">
    * Enable NTP by **Web-UI** `Server configuration`
      ->`Date and time settings`
    * Enable NTP by command
      ```
      timedatectl set-ntp true  
      ```
      >_timedatectl result will show **systemd-timesyncd.service active: yes**_ 
    
      If NTP is Enabled and network is Connected (Using **eth2** connect to router), we will see the item **systemd-timesyncd.service active** is **yes** and **System clock synchronized** is **yes**. Thus, system time will sync from NTP server to get current time.
    * Get NTP status  
      ```
      timedatectl  
      ```
      >_Local time: Mon 2018-08-27 09:24:51 UTC  
      >Universal time: Mon 2018-08-27 09:24:51 UTC  
      >RTC time: n/a  
      >Time zone: n/a (UTC, +0000)  
      >**System clock synchronized: yes**  
      >**systemd-timesyncd.service active: yes**  
      >RTC in local TZ: no_  
      
    * Disable NTP  
      ```
      timedatectl set-ntp false  
      ```
      >_timedatectl result will show **systemd-timesyncd.service active: no**_  
      
    * Using Local NTP server Configuration  
    When starting, systemd-timesyncd will read the configuration file from **/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf**, which looks like as below: 
        >_[Time]  
        >\#NTP=  
        >\#FallbackNTP=time1.google.com time2.google.com time3.google.com time4.google.com_  
    
    	By default, systemd-timesyncd uses the Google Public NTP servers **time[1-4].google.com**, if no other NTP configuration is available. To add time servers or change the provided ones, **uncomment** the relevant line and list their host name or IP separated by a space. For example, we setup NB windows 10 system as NTP server with IP **192.168.1.128**  
        >_[Time]  
        >**NTP=192.168.1.128**  
    	>\#FallbackNTP=time1.google.com time2.google.com time3.google.com time4.google.com_
    
    * BMC connect to local NTP server of windows 10 system  
      Connect to NB through **eth0** EMAC interface, and set static IP **192.168.1.15**  
    
      ```
      ifconfig eth0 up
      ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.15
      ```  
      >_Note: Before that you need to setup your NTP server (192.168.1.128) on Windows 10 system first_  
      
      Modify **/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf** file on BMC as we mentioned
        >_[Time]  
        >**NTP=192.168.1.128**_  
      
      Re-start NTP to make effect about our configuration change  
      ```
      systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd.service
      ```  
      Check status of NTP that show already synced to our local time server 
      ```
      systemctl status systemd-timesyncd.service -l --no-pager
      ```  
      >_Status: "Synchronized to time server 192.168.1.128:123 (192.168.1.128)."_  
      
      Verify **Web-UI** `Server overview`->`BMC time` whether sync from NTP server as same as **timedatectl**. (Note: timedatectl time zone default is UTC, thus you will find the BMC time is UTC+8)
      ```
      timedatectl  
      ```
      >_Local time: Thu 2018-09-06 07:24:16 UTC  
      >Universal time: Thu 2018-09-06 07:24:16 UTC  
      >RTC time: n/a  
      >Time zone: n/a (UTC, +0000)  
      >System clock synchronized: yes  
      >systemd-timesyncd.service active: yes  
      >RTC in local TZ: no_  

  * **Time settings**  
    **Phosphor-time-manager** provides two objects on D-Bus
      >_/xyz/openbmc_project/time/bmc_
      >
      >_/xyz/openbmc_project/time/host_  

      **BMC time** is used by journal event log record, and **Host time** is used by Host do IPMI Set SEL Time command to sync BMC time from Host mechanism in an era of BMC without any network interface.  
      Currently, we cannot set Host time no matter what we use **busctl**, **REST API** or **ipmitool set time set** command. Due to **phosphor-settingd** this daemon set default TimeOwner is BMC and TimeSyncMethod is NTP. Thus, when TimeOwner is BMC that is not allow to set Host time anyway.

      A summary of which cases the time can be set on BMC or HOST

      Mode      | Owner | Set BMC Time  | Set Host Time
      --------- | ----- | ------------- | -------------------
      NTP       | BMC   | Fail to set   | Not allowed (Default setting)
      NTP       | HOST  | Not allowed   | Not allowed
      NTP       | SPLIT | Fail to set   | OK
      NTP       | BOTH  | Fail to set   | Not allowed
      MANUAL    | BMC   | OK            | Not allowed
      MANUAL    | HOST  | Not allowed   | OK
      MANUAL    | SPLIT | OK            | OK
      MANUAL    | BOTH  | OK            | OK

      If user would like to set Host time that need to set Owner to SPLIT in NTP mode or set Owner to HOST/SPLIT/BOTH in MANUAL mode. However, change Host time will not effect BMC time and journal event log timestamp.

    **Set Time Owner to Split**
    ```
    ### With busctl on BMC
    busctl set-property xyz.openbmc_project.Settings \
       /xyz/openbmc_project/time/owner xyz.openbmc_project.Time.Owner \
       TimeOwner s xyz.openbmc_project.Time.Owner.Owners.Split
    
    ### With REST API on remote host
    curl -c cjar -b cjar -k -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X  PUT  -d \
       '{"data": "xyz.openbmc_project.Time.Owner.Owners.Split" }' \
       https://${BMC_IP}/xyz/openbmc_project/time/owner/attr/TimeOwner
    ```
    **TimeZone**  
    According OpenBMC current design that only support UTC TimeZone now, we can use below command to get current support TimeZone on BMC
    ```
    timedatectl list-timezones
    ```

### Sensor
[phosphor-hwmon](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-hwmon) daemon will periodically check the sensor reading to see if it exceeds lower bound or upper bound . If alarm condition is hit, the [phosphor-sel-logger](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-sel-logger) handles all sensor events to add new IPMI SEL records to the journal, [phosphor-host-ipmid](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/phosphor-host-ipmid) will convert the journal SEL records to IPMI SEL record format and reply to host.

**How to use**

* **Configure sensor**
    
  * Add Sensor Configuration File
  
    Each sensor **temperature**, **adc**, **fan**, **peci** and **power** has a [hwmon config file](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/tree/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/sensors/phosphor-hwmon/obmc/hwmon/ahb/apb) and [ipmi sdr config file](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/configuration/olympus-nuvoton-yaml-config/olympus-nuvoton-ipmi-sensors.yaml) that defines the sensor name and its warning or critical thresholds. These files are located under **recipes-phosphor/sensors/phosphor-hwmon%/obmc/hwmon/apb/** and **recipes-phosphor/configuration/olympus-nuvoton-yaml-config/olympus-nuvoton-ipmi-sensors.yaml**.  

    Below is hwmon config for a LM75 sensor on BMC. The sensor type is **temperature** and its name is **bmc_card**. It has warning and critical thresholds for **upper** and **lower** bound.
      ```
      LABEL_temp1 = "bmc_card"
      WARNHI_temp1 = "110000"
      WARNLO_temp1 = "5000"
      CRITHI_temp1 = "115000"
      CRITLO_temp1 = "0"

### BIOS POST Code
In NPCM750, we support a FIFO for monitoring BIOS POST Code. Typically, this feature is used by the BMC to "watch" host boot progress via port 0x80 writes made by the BIOS during the boot process.

**Source URL**

This is a patch for enabling BIOS POST Code feature in [phosphor-host-postd](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-host-postd) on Nuvoton's NPCM750.

* [https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/host/phosphor-host-postd_%25.bbappend](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/host/phosphor-host-postd_%25.bbappend)

**How to use**

* Execute BIOS POST Code test program by command in BMC
  ```
  snooper
  ```

  This command will trigger snooper test program to record BIOS POST Code from port 0x80 of host and save to file with timestamp filename in BMC for each host power on or reset.
  > _Saved filename format example: 2019_4_30_11_52_35_ON_

* Server Power on

  Press `Power on` button from `Server control` ->`Server power operations` of WebUI.
  During server power on, snooper test program will print received BIOS POST Code on screen and record to file in BMC at the same time.
  > _Snooper test program print received BIOS POST Code example:_
    > _recv: 0x3
        recv: 0x2

### FRU
<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/cab7306/openbmc/fru.png">

Field Replaceable Unit. The FRU Information is used to primarily to provide “inventory” information about the boards that the FRU Information Device is located on. In NPCM750, we connect EEPROM component as FRU Information Device to support this feature. Typically, this feature is used by the BMC to "monitor" host server health about H/W copmonents status.

**Source URL**

This is a patch for enabling FRU feature in [phosphor-impi-fru](https://github.com/openbmc/ipmi-fru-parser) on Nuvoton's NPCM750.

* [https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/ipmi/phosphor-ipmi-fru_%25.bbappend](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/ipmi/phosphor-ipmi-fru_%25.bbappend)

**How to use**
* Modify DTS settings of EEPROM for FRU.
  For example about DTS **nuvoton-npcm750-evb.dts**:
  ```
  i2c4: i2c@84000 {
      #address-cells = <1>;
      #size-cells = <0>;
      bus-frequency = <100000>;
      status = "okay";
      eeprom@54 {
          compatible = "atmel,24c64";
          reg = <0x54>;
      };
  };
  ```

  According DTS modification, you also need to remember modify your EEPROM file description content about **SYSFS_PATH** and **FRUID**. Below is example for our EEPROM file description **[motherboard](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/ipmi/phosphor-ipmi-fru/obmc/eeproms/system/chassis/motherboard)**:
  ```
  SYSFS_PATH=/sys/bus/i2c/devices/3-0050/eeprom
  FRUID=1
  ```
  **SYSFS_PATH** is the path according your DTS setting and **FRUID** is arbitrary number but need to match **Fruid** in **[config.yaml](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/configuration/olympus-nuvoton-yaml-config/olympus-nuvoton-ipmi-fru.yaml)** file. Below is example for when **Fruid** set as 1:
  ```
  1: #Fruid
    /system/chassis/motherboard:
      entityID: 7
      entityInstance: 1
      interfaces:

**How to use**

In order to automatically apply accurate and responsive correction to a fan control function, we use the `swampd` to handle output PWM signal. For enable this daemon, basically we need configuring the swampd configuration file and deploy a system service for start this daemon as below steps.

>_NOTICE: In current solution, we only use stepwise mechanism to control fans. But the swampd also can controls fan with PID by tuning parameters according to customer platform._

* The swampd(PID control daemon) is a Margin-based daemon running within the OpenBMC environment. It uses a well-defined [configuration file](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/fans/phosphor-pid-control/config-olympus-nuvoton.json) to control the temperature of the tray components to keep them within operating conditions.

    Here is a configuraion example shows how to using one PWM control more than one fans on system.

        },
    ]
    ```
    The [PID README](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-pid-control/blob/master/configure.md) provide more detail about the meaning for each parameter.

    Roughly speaking, there are two main section in configuration file: **sensor** and **zones**.
    **Sensors** defined the all component which are involved PID like temperature sensors, or fans.
    **Zones** defined the mechanism how the swampd control each fans by setting parameters.

    The most important in **sensors** section is the settings of `readPath` and `writePath`.
    Sensors like temperature sensor or margin sensor must only set readPath, and fill up empty string to writePath.
    Fans could set the D-Bus path to readPath, also set the pwm system path to writePath.
    More detail about readPath and writePath please refer README that mentioned above.

    There are four PID controller types user can use: `fan`, `temp`, `margin`, and `stepwise` in **zones**.
    User can tune the PID parameters following the [tuning README](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-pid-control/blob/master/tuning.md). 

    In above example case, the fan PID controller has a lot of PID parameters. And we only use the stepwise controller to control whole zone, so the PID parameters in fan controller like `integralCoeff` or `outLim_max` would not work.
    And the parameter `inputs` for stepwise controller must be thermal sensor.
    Please note the parameter `setpoint` is no meaning for type `fan` and `stepwise` currently, and cannot be left out.

    If user want to control whole zone by stepwise controller like example configuration, the key point is set reading and output.
    The `stepwise` PID use the mapping of reading and output value instead of set RPM setpoint.
    The reading and output value should be a pair, and user can set 20 pairs in maximum, one more pairs at least.
    And the `stepwise` will return output setpoint if temperature **is larger** than reading value.
    For example, assume here are pairs of `stepwise` reading and output:
    ```
    {
      "reading": {25, 26, 27},
      "output": {10, 20, 30}
    }
    ```

    If the temperature reading is 25.5°C, the return value will be 10.
    And if the reading value is 26.5°C, the stepwise controller will set 20% RPM to fan(s).


* OpenBMC will run swampd through [phosphor-pid-control.service](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/fans/phosphor-pid-control/phosphor-pid-control.service) that controls the fans by pre-defined zones. Here is a example service.
    ```
    [Service]
    Type=simple
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/swampd
    Restart=always
    RestartSec=5
    StartLimitInterval=0
    ExecStopPost=/usr/bin/fan-default-speed.sh
    ```
    + **ExecStopPost** that means an additional commands that are executed after the service is stopped.

## IPMI / DCMI

### SOL IPMI
<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/8afa8a2/openbmc/sol_ipmi_win10.PNG">

The Serial over LAN (SoL) via IPMI redirects the output of the server’s serial port to a command/terminal window on your workstation.

The user uses the ipmi tool like [ipmiutil](http://ipmiutil.sourceforge.net/) to interact with SOL via IPMI. Here the ipmiutil is used as an example.

The patch integrates [phosphor-net-ipmid](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/ipmi/phosphor-ipmi-net_%25.bbappend) into Nuvoton's NPCM750 solution for OpenBMC.

**How to use**

1. Download the [ipmiutil](http://ipmiutil.sourceforge.net/) according to the host OS in your workstation.

   > _Here it's assumed that the host OS is Windows 10 and ipmiutil for Windows is downloaded and used accordingly._

2. Run SOL:

    * Extract or install the ipmiutil package to a folder in your workstation in advance.
    * Launch a command window and navigate to that folder.
    * Input the following command in the command window.
      ```
      ipmiutil sol -N 192.168.0.2 -U root -P 0penBmc -J 3 -V 4 -a
      ```
    * (Optional) Configure the `Properties` of the command window to see the entire output of SOL.
      > _Screen Buffer Size Width: 200_
        _Screen Buffer Size Height: 400_
        _Window Size Width: 100_
        _Window Size Height: 40_

4. End SOL session:

    * Press the "~" key (using the shift key + "`" key) and "." key at the same time in the command window.
    * Input the following command in the command window.
      ```
      ipmiutil sol -N 192.168.0.2 -U root -P 0penBmc -J 3 -V 4 -d

### Host Power Budget Control

Host Power Budget Control provides a mechanism for implement IPMI DCMI messages by using D-Bus and IPMB.

Please refer to [IPMI Website](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/servers/ipmi/ipmi-home.html) for details about Message Bridging.

<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/dfdfd04/openbmc/message_bridge.png">

IPMI daemon would set or get D-Bus property to/from path like: `/xyz/openbmc_project/control/host0/power_cap` when get DCMI command from IPMI tool via network or LPC.
[Phosphor-node-manager-proxy](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/tree/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/ipmi/phosphor-node-manager-proxy) will handle the property change and present the property value.
Once the **phosphor-node-manager-proxy** property changed, it will prepare IPMB package data and call D-Bus method "sendRequest" to D-Bus path: `/xyz/openbmc_project/Ipmi/Channel/Ipmb`.
Finally, IPMB gets the request and constructs I2C command from the request, then sends the I2C command to ME(Intel Management Engine) for getting information which controlled by ME.

The patch integrates the [ipmid](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-host-ipmid), [phosphor-node-manager-proxy](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/tree/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/ipmi/phosphor-node-manager-proxy) and [ipmbbridge](https://github.com/openbmc/ipmbbridge) projects.

**How to use**

1. Configure [ipmb-channel.json](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/ipmi/phosphor-ipmi-ipmb/ipmb-olympus-channels.json) as below sample. Check schematic to fill up BMC and ME I2C address, and each sys path.
    ```
    "channels": [
      {
        "type": "me",
        "master-path": "/dev/i2c-5",
        "slave-path": "/sys/bus/i2c/devices/5-1010/slave-mqueue",
        "bmc-addr": 32,
        "remote-addr": 44
      }
    ]
    ```

2. Deploy **phosphor-node-manager-proxy** from Intel-BMC project [node-manager](https://github.com/Intel-BMC/node-manager), because the package still not merge in OpenBMC project. And modify the interface define if need. The patch [0001-change-the-value-number-from-int64-to-double.patch](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/ipmi/phosphor-node-manager-proxy/0001-change-the-value-number-from-int64-to-double.patch) for node manager is change the property type that make bmcweb can get the sensor value on web UI.

3. Install the ipmitool in host OS, here using Ubuntu 18.04 as example.

    * Using apt command install ipmitool.
      ```
      sudo apt install ipmitool
      ```

4. Test power budget control.

    * Send DCMI commnad via LPC
      ```
      sudo ipmitool dcmi get_mc_id_string
      ```

      This command would return result as below:

      ```
        Get Management Controller Indentifier String: olympus-nuvoton
      ```

    * Send DCMI command via network
      ```
      sudo ipmitool -I lanplus -H 10.103.152.12 -U root -P 0penBmc dcmi power get_limit
      ```

      The result will show like below if everything is OK.

      ```
      Current Limit State: Power Limit Active
      Exception actions:   Hard Power Off & Log Event to SEL
      Power Limit:         500 Watts
      Correction time:     0 milliseconds
      Sampling period:     0 seconds

<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/master/openbmc/access_ldap_via_bmc.png">

The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an open, vendor-neutral, industry standard application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an Internet Protocol (IP) network.

LDAP is specified in a series of Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Standard Track publications called Request for Comments (RFCs), using the description language ASN.1.

A common use of LDAP is to provide a central place to store usernames and passwords. This allows many different applications and services to connect to the LDAP server to validate users.

      bitbake -C fetch openldap
      bitbake obmc-phosphor-image
      ```
    * Program the updated image into BMC.

5. Test LDAP server.

    * Connect BMC and LDAP server in same local network and power on it.
    * Log in BMC from the console program (like Tera Term) with the root account (root/0penBmc).
      > _The console program is used to display a debug console provided by BMC._

    * The IP address for the LDAP server is 192.168.0.101 for now.
    * Set up IP addresses for BMC and LDAP server so that they can ping each other.
      + For example, set BMC's IP address to 192.168.0.2. Input the following command in the console program.
        ```
        ifconfig eth2 192.168.0.2
        ```

        > _Please replace **192.168.0.2** with your IP configuration for BMC._

    * Execute the following command in the console program.
      ```
      ldapsearch -ZZ -h 192.168.0.101 -D "cn=admin,dc=ldap,dc=example,dc=com" -b "dc=ldap,dc=example,dc=com" -w secret
      ```
      > _Please replace **192.168.0.101** with your IP configuration for LDAP server._
      > _The ldapsearch example is to display all the data stored in the LDAP server using a TLS connection._

    * You could use the account **user1** stored in the LDAP server to log in WebUI running on BMC.

      + Some descriptions about the LDIF used by the LDAP server and authentication process are provided here. Please refer to the six snapshots in the following description.
        > _To login an account, the authentication logic has to check the following criteria._
        > _**bmc-uid**: It stands for the BMC machine that the account is used to login. The BMC machines are grouped by DN **ou=ap_group,dc=ldap,dc=example,dc=com**. One BMC machine can be in multiple groups at the same time. (see **ap_group** below)_
        <img width="30%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/c8c60b29/openbmc/bmc1_info.png">
        <img width="30%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/c8c60b29/openbmc/bmc2_info.png">
        
        > _**ap_group**: Applications like web server, email, ftp and so on are deployed on the servers attched by BMC machines. Therefore, grouping by applications is taken into the authentication process. The authentication refuses an account to log in some BMC machine if that machine is not deployed under the certain **ap_group**_
        <img width="30%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/c8c60b29/openbmc/email_info.png">
        <img width="30%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/c8c60b29/openbmc/webserver_info.png">
        
        > _**people**: It contains the account information (login/privileges) stored in the LDAP server. An account can join multiple **ap_group** simutaneously._
        <img width="30%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/c8c60b29/openbmc/user1_logininfo.png">
        <img width="30%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/c8c60b29/openbmc/user2_logininfo.png">
        
        > _**user-login-disabled**: While this attribute's value is 1, it is not allowed to login with the account's membership of the specific **ap_group**_.
        > _**user-login-interface**: It's used as a channel via that the account logins for an **ap_group**. For example, **web** stands for logging in a BMC machine via WebUI. If **web** does not exist in any **user-login-interface** attributes an account owns under a certain ap_group, it means that the user cannot use this account to login as a member of the preferred ap_group via WebUI._

      + Use an LDAP tool to modify the field **macAddress** of the DN **bmc-uid=bmc1,ou=bmc,dc=ldap,dc=example,dc=com** stored in the LDAP server.
        > _The mac address modification is for the ethernet module on BMC you currently test with._

      + To get the mac address desired, input the following command in the console program.
        ```
        ifconfig eth0
        ```
        > _Locate the keyword **HWaddr** displayed in the console program._
        > _Copy the value next to HWaddr to override the value of the field **macAddress** of the DN **bmc-uid=bmc1,ou=bmc,dc=ldap,dc=example,dc=com**._

      + Launch a browser and navigate to the BMC's IP address.
        > _Bypass the secure warning and continue to the website._

      + Use user1/123 to log in WebUI.
        > _user1 is the login ID._
        > _123 is the login password._
        > _The **bmc-uid** for the BMC machine used for this test is bmc1. According to the LDIF provided, the BMC machine bmc1 is deployed under the **ap_group** email and the the BMC machine bmc2 is deployed under **ap_group** webserver. Also one can tell from the snapshots, user1 and user2 have different **user-login-interface** settings for the **ap_group** email and **ap_group** webserver respectively._
        > _User1 is able to log on bmc1 via WebUI since the following conditions are met: the BMC machine bmc1 is deployed under **ap_group** email.; user1 is a member of the **ap_group** email.; user1 has an **user-login-interface** setting as **web** for that group and value of user1's **user-login-disabled** attribute is not set._
        > _Although user2 is also a member of the **ap_group** email, it does not have an **user-login-interface** setting as **web** for that group. Under such conditions, user2 is not allowed to log on bmc1. User2 does have an **user-login-interface** setting as **web** for the **ap_group** webserver but bmc1 is not deployed under the **ap_group** webserver._
        > _The description above explains why user1 is used for this test._

    * Password modification is also available to LDAP accounts via WebUI.
      + Log in WebUI using user1/123 as mentioned in previous section.
      + Navigate to `Access control` menu item on the left panel and select it.
      + A sub menu item `Local users` pops up and select it.
      + Modify the password value for user1 by selecting the icon at just the right side of the text area "Account status".

      + Input the same new password twice.
        > _The input locations are right below **USER PASSWORD** and **CONFIRM USER PASSWORD** text area._

      + Press the `Save` button.
        > _A message **Success! User has been updated successfully.** is expected to show then._

      + Log out WebUI and log in again with the new password for user1.

    * Log in BMC via SSH using an LDAP account.
      + Make sure that configurations stated in Step 5 for BMC and LDAP server are set accordingly and ping between LDAP server and BMC is okay.
      + Install **ssh** in Ubuntu with root privilege if ssh client is not available. Open a terminal and input the following command.
        ```
        sudo apt-get install ssh
        ```

      + Open a terminal in Ubuntu to log in BMC using the LDAP account **user1** and its password via SSH. Input the following command in the terminal.
        ```
        ssh user1@192.168.0.2
        ```
        > _Please replace **192.168.0.2** with your IP configuration for BMC._
        > _It requires the account to be in the priv-admin group in the LDAP group database for accessing SSH._  
        > _Please refer to [group.ldif](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc-util/blob/master/ldap_server/ldif/group.ldif) for more details._

    * Execute ipmi commands using an LDAP account.
      + Make sure that configurations stated in Step 5 for BMC and LDAP server are set accordingly and ping between LDAP server and BMC is okay.
      + Install **ipmitool** in Ubuntu with root privilege for the demonstration purpose. Open a terminal and input the following command.
        ```
        sudo apt-get install ipmitool
        ```

      + Open a terminal in Ubuntu to execute ipmi commands to BMC using the LDAP account **user2** and its password **123** via ipmitool. Input the following command in the terminal.
        ```
        sudo ipmitool -H 192.168.0.2 -U user2 -P 123 -I lanplus user list
        ```

## JTAG Master
JTAG master is implemented on BMC to facilitate debugging host CPU or programming CPLD device.  

**Source URL**

* [https://github.com/Intel-BMC/asd](https://github.com/Intel-BMC/asd)
* [https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc-util/tree/master/loadsvf](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc-util/tree/master/loadsvf)

### ASD
<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/870d09e/openbmc/asd.png">
The Intel® At-Scale Debug feature allows for using any host system to run the Debug tool stack while connecting to the target system across the network. The target system must have a BMC which has physical connectivity to the JTAG pins as a minimum requirement of functionality.    

**How to use**

Here uses the RunBMC Olympus server as example.

1. switch JPC1 jumper on host to 2-3.
2. configure GPIO40(BMC_XDP_JTAG_SEL_N) to connect BMC JTAG to Host CPU
    ```
    echo 40 > /sys/class/gpio/export
    echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio40/value
    ```
3. configure BMC_TCK_MUX_SEL pin to CPU TCK
    ```
    echo 22 > /sys/class/gpio/export
    echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio22/value
    ```
4. Run ASD daemon on BMC
    ```
    asd -u -n eth1 --log-level=warning -p 5123
    ```
5. Launch CScripts on debug host
    ```
    Assume CScripts source folder = $CS, OpenIPC source folder = $OIPC
    Edit $OIPC/openipc/Config/SKX/SKX_ASD_RC-Pins.xml
    - Change ip address to BMC ip address
    Edit $OIPC/openipc/Config/OpenIpcConfig.xml
    - Change DefaultIpcConfig tag as <DefaultIpcConfig Name="SKX_ASD_RC-Pins"/>
    export IPC_PATH=$OIPC/openipc/Bin
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$IPC_PATH
    Go to $CS/cscripts, execute "python startCscripts.py -a ipc"
    ```
6. Execute OpenIPC idcode operation in CScripts command prompt. It will show the TAP device's idcode.
    ```
    >>> import ipccli
    >>> ipc = ipccli.baseaccess()
    >>> ipc.idcode(0)
    ```


### CPLD Programming
The motherboard on server have a CPLD device that can be upgraded firmware on it. BMC can load svf file to program CPLD via JTAG.  

**How to use**

run loadsvf on Runbmc to program CPLD. Specify the svf file name with -s.
```
loadsvf -d /dev/jtag0 -s firmware.svf
```

## System Event Policy

phosphor-dbus-monitor service can watch on specific dbus objects/properties and perform predefined event callbacks when the property state has changed or meets the condition defined in config file.  

**Source URL**
* [phosphor-dbus-monitor](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-monitor)
* [phosphor-snmp](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-snmp)


### Event Callbacks
The event callbacks can be the following actions. Logging to journal or elog, calling d-bus methods, or sending snmp traps. Here is an example that log to journal and send d-bus message to shutdown host when the specific temperature sensor reaches the critical high threshold.

* [Example config](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-runbmc-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/configuration/runbmc-nuvoton-yaml-config/runbmc-nuvoton-dbus-monitor-config.yaml)

### SNMP trap
**How to use** 
1. Install snmp trap receiver on the management server. Refer to the [link](https://blog.cadena-it.com/linux-tips-how-to/snmp-trap-receiver-with-ubuntu/) for the installation.
    * Copy [BMC notification MIB](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-snmp/blob/master/mibs/NotificationMIB.txt) to `/usr/share/snmp/mibs`.
    * Run snmptrapd with -m option to load custom MIB
    ```
    snmptrapd -m OPENBMC-NOTIFICATION-MIB -Lf /var/log/snmptrap.log -f
    ```
2. Specify snmp manager ip/port in Openbmc WebUI
   ```
    Server configuration
     -> SNMP settings
       -> Add Managers
          -> enter the snmp manger ip and port(default is 162)
    ```
3. Check snmp trap log in snmp manager.
   * /var/log/snmptrap.log
   * the OIDs in log file will be translated to human readable string defined in MIB
   * Example:
   ```
   TRAP2, SNMP v2c, community publicDU Attribute/Value Pair Array:
   SNMPv2-SMI::snmpModules.1.1.4.1.0 = OID: OPENBMC-NOTIFICATION-MIB::obmcErrorNotification
   OPENBMC-NOTIFICATION-MIB::obmcErrorID = Gauge32: 135
   OPENBMC-NOTIFICATION-MIB::obmcErrorTimestamp = Opaque: UInt64: 780329535445925888
   OPENBMC-NOTIFICATION-MIB::obmcErrorSeverity = INTEGER: 3
   OPENBMC-NOTIFICATION-MIB::obmcErrorMessage = STRING:   "xyz.openbmc_project.Sensor.Threshold.Error.WarningLow"
   ```

* [https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-phosphor/nuvoton-layer/recipes-phosphor/ipmi/phosphor-ipmi-flash_%25.bbappend](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-phosphor/nuvoton-layer/recipes-phosphor/ipmi/phosphor-ipmi-flash_%25.bbappend)

### HOST Tool
<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/322d0d3/openbmc/in-band-fu.png">

The host-tool depends on `ipmi-blob-tool` and `pciutils`.

#### Building pciutils
Check out the [pciutils source](https://github.com/pciutils/pciutils).

Then run these commands in the source directory.
```
make SHARED=yes
make SHARED=yes install
make install-lib
```

#### Building ipmi-blob-tool
Check out the [ipmi-blob-tool source](https://github.com/openbmc/ipmi-blob-tool).
Then run these commands in the source directory.

```
./bootstrap.sh
./configure
make
make install
```

#### Building burn_my_bmc (the host-tool)
Check out the [phosphor-ipmi-flash source](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/phosphor-ipmi-flash).
Then run these commands in the source directory.
If you choose "enable-nuvoton-p2a-vga", then the tool will support LPC and PCI-VGA.
If you choose "enable-nuvoton-p2a-mbox", then the tool will support LPC and PCI-MailBox

```
./bootstrap.sh
./configure --disable-build-bmc-blob-handler --enable-nuvoton-p2a-vga
make
make install
```

**How to use**
1. If you want to do firmware update over LPC, then you need to check the memory address which BIOS allocates for LPC.
You could use "ioport" tool and following commands to get the address.
    ```
    sudo outb 0x4e 0x07
    sudo outb 0x4f 0x0f

    # Host address a7-a0
    sudo outb 0x4e 0xF4
    sudo inb 0x4f

    # Host address a15-a8
    sudo outb 0x4e 0xF5
    sudo inb 0x4f

    # Host address a23-a16
    sudo outb 0x4e 0xF6
    sudo inb 0x4f

    # Host address a32-a24
    sudo outb 0x4e 0xF7
    sudo inb 0x4f

    # shm active?
    sudo outb 0x4e 0x30
    sudo inb 0x4f

    ```

2. Here is an example for upadting over LPC, and --length is fixed.
    ```
    sudo ./burn_my_bmc --command update --interface ipmilpc --image image-bmc --sig image-bmc.sig --type image --address 0x817e0000 --length 0x1000
    ```

3. Here is an example for upadting over PCI(both VGA and MailBox)and --type is fixed
    ```
    sudo ./burn_my_bmc --command update --interface ipmipci --image image-bmc --sig image-bmc.sig --type image
    ```

### IPMI Library
This is an OpenBMC IPMI Library (Handler) for In-Band Firmware Update.

**How to use**
1. You need to enable the way you want to transfer data from host to BMC
    ```
    nuvoton-lpc
    enable-nuvoton-p2a-mbox
    enable-nuvoton-p2a-vga
    ```

2. select the corresponding address for IPMI_FLASH_BMC_ADDRESS_nuvoton
    ```
    0x7F400000
    0xF0848000
    0xc0008000
    ```
